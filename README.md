# Logistic Regression Analysis using Python

This repository contains Python code for performing logistic regression analysis on a binary dataset. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from [UCLA's Institute for Digital Research & Education](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv).

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to perform logistic regression analysis in Python, following a similar approach to the original R code provided by UCLA. This README file will guide you through the key aspects of the project, the data used, and how to run the code.

## Original R Code

The R version of the code that this project is based on is available at [UCLA Statistical Consulting Group's website](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/). The original code provides a comprehensive guide to logistic regression in R, and this project aims to replicate the analysis in Python using libraries like `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Files in the Repository

- **logistic_regression.py**: The main script that performs logistic regression on the dataset.
- **binary.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.
- **README.md**: This README file.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `statsmodels`

## Notice

There is absence of using profiled log-likelihood to calculate confidence intervals
